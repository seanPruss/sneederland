My dotfiles

## Overview

This is my dotfiles repo which includes a script that installs all needed
packages and links my configuration with GNU Stow. Feel free to copy the stuff
in this repo since I copied a lot of it mostly from [Eric Murphy](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz).
You should also look at the docs for the packages if you wanna change anything.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]

> "I use arch btw :3" on every social media post you encounter
