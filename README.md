# The Sneed Packages

This is a fork of [HyprV4](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4) by [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/SolDoesTech)  
with the install script modified to install all my packages.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script will only work on Arch Linux (and Arch-based distros but who uses  
> those anyway?) so put on your knee high socks and cat ears and start commenting  
> "I use arch btw :3" on every social media post you encounter

Clone this repo and run `installer.sh`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seanPruss/the-sneed-packages.git
cd the-sneed-packages
rm -rf .git # do this if you want to create your own fork
./installer.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> My name and noreply github email is in `.gitconfig` so obviously change that  
> to yours
