# SneederLand

A fork of [HyprV4](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4) by [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/SolDoesTech)

## Overview

This is my dotfiles repo which includes a script that installs all needed
packages and links my configuration with GNU Stow. Feel free to copy the stuff
in this repo since I copied a lot of it mostly from [Eric Murphy](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz).
You should also look at the docs for the packages if you wanna change anything.
