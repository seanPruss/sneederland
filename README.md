# The Sneed Packages

This is a fork of [HyprV4](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4) by [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/SolDoesTech)  
with the install script modified to install all my packages.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script will only work on Arch Linux (and Arch-based distros but who uses  
> those anyway?) so put on your knee high socks and cat ears and start commenting  
> "I use arch btw :3" on every social media post you encounter

Clone this repo and run `installer-script`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Clone the repo into the home directory. The installer script assumes that's  
> where the repo is located on your machine.

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/seanPruss/the-sneed-packages.git
cd the-sneed-packages
rm -rf .git # do this if you want to create your own fork
./installer-script
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some configs are tailored to my setup, such as the gbar plugin in pyprland  
> that prefers my HDMI monitor instead of my laptop monitor. Feel free to make whatever  
> changes you want to tailor the config to you, but some things like changing  
> colour scheme may take some time.
