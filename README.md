# The Sneed Packages

This is a fork of [HyprV4](https://github.com/SolDoesTech/HyprV4) by [SolDoesTech](https://github.com/SolDoesTech)  
with the install script modified to install all my packages.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script will only work on Arch Linux (and Arch-based distros but who uses  
> those anyway?) so put on your knee high socks and cat ears and start commenting  
> "I use arch btw :3"

Clone this repo and run `set-hypr`
